# The-IMDB-dataset-coursework-Jupyter-Notebook
Coursework from Deep Learning With Python by Francois Chollet. We will work with the IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. Theyâ€™re split into 25,000 reviews (sequences of words have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary), for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.
